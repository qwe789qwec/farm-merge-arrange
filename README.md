You need to use a computer, install Python and OpenCV, and then run FMV_arrange.py.
It's best to use dual monitors, with one running the program and the other displaying the game screen.
The game screen needs to hide the chat and be set to full screen, otherwise, the program might fail to capture it.
There might still be many issues. Feel free to point them out, but I might not fix them... This is just for fun.
